# Bloomberg-CRPR-ratings-into-dataframe
Want to create a ratings dataframe from Bloomberg but dont want to pay a commision ? 
Just copy the content of bloomberg CRPR (credid risk profile) for each ticker into excel and run that code.

EDIT : bloomberg functions are not the same between tickers (same functions but have different names).
It makes program 'can't see' some ratings - needs to be fixed by modifying 'slownik_ratings' and code.
